Doing project 2 today.
First, I created a repo name project 2 and located a folder which help me easy for the project. 
I read and followed all the instruction that were provided in the project. But on the Gitbash I was not able to do the command "cal". It said command not found.
On step 4, I read the instruction and I leaned how to create a file under bash by using command nano "filename.sh". Following the steps, I got everything correct except "cal" command.
Next, I went through a whole tutorial and created all the files that I needed for the project and successfully execute most the steps and command.
Step 7, script execution. I actually did it correct but I did not get the result as line 5 permission denied. My result came out as normal as line 7 in the video.
hello-world.sh was easy to follow and I really enjoyed it.
Step 10, simple backup bash. First, I create a file backup.sh and completed step. I got the result same as the tutorial. There is little bit different between and I think that was because the tutorial use different terminal compare with bash.
Under variable, I created welcome.sh file and it worked. The code was simple.
After the variable step, there was a backup file update following up with the step and I started getting errors. I think there was because different folder but I tried couple of way the navigate the file system require for and It did not work.
About the function file. I got correct but with the backup file my result did not come out as the direction. The system was unable to find the files. It said no such files or directory and it show 0 under both files and directory to be included even though I eliminated the -type f as show under project 2.
Next, comparison and if_else file was great. I got both correctly. But as I mentioned at the step earlier the backup file got error. I still updated the backup file but I still got the same answer which were unable to find the file and it showed all 0. 
After that, I keep working on the rest of the tutorial on while.sh, param.sh and items.sh. They worked well.
Finally, I checked on the folder I created all the file that I have been working on. I used command git add, git commit then I used "git push -u origin master" to push every files into the repo. At first, it took me while to do every single files because I did not know that I can use -A to push all of them at same time.
